1. In Product data model, each Product document includes a category_id field, which serves as a reference to the corresponding category in the Product_Category data model. category_id field stores the id of Product_Category model as a result each Product is related to Product_Category data model. 
This relational structure adheres to best practices in database design, promoting data integrity and streamlined querying capabilities.

Methods such as findById() in Mongoose can be used to retrieve product categories associated with specific products.By utilizing the category_id stored in the Product document, we can seamlessly query the Product_Category data model to obtain comprehensive category information.

2. In Mongoose one can ensure that each product in the "Product" collection has a valid category assigned to it by defining a schema with a reference to the "Product_Category" schema, in the above figure in Product data model category_id field stores the reference to Product_category model by storing it's id.
Using findById() method on the "Product" schema to check if the assigned category exists in the "Product_Category" collection. If it doesn't, an error can be throwned. Here's an example:-

const category = await Product_Category.findById(category_id);
if (!category) {
  throw new Error('No category found');
}
